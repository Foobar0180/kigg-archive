There are many lessons to be learned by looking at it. :-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some rough start I managed to get the project up and running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have still some minor issues. The most disturbing being that I am unable to edit a story once it is created. <br>\r\nIf I click on edit on a story, I do get the editor window on the screen, but the window is sort of grayed out, like an inactive window. <br>\r\nI cannot click anything, not even the close icon on the dialog. The only chance to continue is to click the browser back-button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny help is very welcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\n   Andreas Kroll\r\n",
