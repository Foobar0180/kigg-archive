    "Description": "Hi here,\r\nJust downloaded the project as it seems to be a really good project to get my head around with MVC.\r\nHere's the situation :\r\n- I have VS2008 running + framework 3.5\r\n- Installed MVC 2\r\n- Downloaded the Kigg project. \r\n- Trying to open V2.X with VS2008\r\n- Every other projects in the directory loads alright but Kigg.Web.[ Error message is : Kigg.Web.csproj cannot be opened. This project type is not supported by this installation. ]\r\n\r\nQuestion is:\r\n- Is it due to MVC 2 ? Cause one of my mate could successfully open it using MVC + VS2008.\r\n- How do I resolve it ? (other than uninstalling MVC2 and installing MVC)\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.",
