I was wondering it lacks the functionality of voting up/down a comment like one can do in Digg or Reddit.com. I doubt it is already available and need some work to make it work but if it is like that please help me. Otherwise some help will be really appreciated to implement this functionality. I think this feature will add alot more value to this project. I am an asp.net developer but relatively new in mvc architecture.&nbsp;</p>",
