When I perform relevant keyword searches, I can't find them either. It's like they just disappeared into thin air. Yet when I try to resubmit them, I get a dup error message. Here are 2 examples.\n\nhttp://dotnetshoutout.com/NU-RubyGems-package-manager-for-NET\nhttp://dotnetshoutout.com/Coding-Under-Influence-Complex-code-isnt-always-better",
