As we get more and more visitors on our site who comment on articles, I need to have an overview of the latest comments so that people can follow the comments. At the moment, there is no way that people can see the comments other then going to the article itself. This is very time consuming and therefor many people will not participate in discussions/commenting.</p>\r\n<p>Has anyone something available that I can reuse? Or is anyone willing to help me? I am not a developer so I can't do this myself.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Jos</p>",
