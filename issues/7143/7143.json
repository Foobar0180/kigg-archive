    "Description": "I downloaded the release package for Kigg and installed it. Runs successfully on 4.0 runtime. However search *does not* work. Searching for any term takes me to the good ol' something unholy happened page. I see others had this issue and the issue was closed. It still is an issue so the issue needs to be reopened. If there is a fix please post it. ",
