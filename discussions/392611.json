    "Html": "<p>Hi There,</p>\r\n<p>Hope you are doing alright there.</p>\r\n<p>Which version of the source code you are dealing with?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is pretty difficult to debug without looking at the problem. Please make sure that you are compiling the web app with target framework of \".NET Framework 3.5\" and see how it goes. In order to do this, right click on the kigg.web project and click on the properties. In the \"Application\" tab, there is a Target framework dropdown where you select .NET Framework 3.5 and save the project. Now rebuild your web app and it should work. If necessary do this for all the projects in the solution and rebuild the whole project.</p>\r\n<p>Again it is very difficult to debug without looking at the problem. The above solution might work or might not work for you.</p>\r\n<p>It depends on the which version of the source code you downloaded. Let me know how it goes and I will give you a stable version that I have just found in my old lappy which is working just fine in my lappy with VS 2010. Again it depends on your system build.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Narendra</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"sharepoint community site\" href=\"http://www.sharepointsidekick.com\" target=\"_blank\">sharepoint&nbsp;community site</a></p>",
