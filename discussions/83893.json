These entries have the prefix ''PUBLISHED'' or ''NEW&quot;&quot;. So far so good.</p>\r\n<p>I have two questions. What is the difference between PUBLISHED and NEW? There are many PUBLISHED entries and only a few NEW entries. My second question, I noticed that sometimes the same entries are published twice to Twitter with several minutes interval. Anyone any idea why this happens?</p>\r\n<p>The site can be viewed at: http://www.PartijPolitiekNieuws.nl (about political news in the Netherlands).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any help!</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Jos</p>",
