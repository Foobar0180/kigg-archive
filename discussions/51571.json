    "Html": "<p>Two things. Firstly, see my post that solves the OpenID issue on IIS6: <a href=\"http://kigg.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=50125\">http://kigg.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=50125</a></p>\r\n<p>Then I found that all I needed to do to support IIS6 was to do the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Virtual Directory</strong> Properties -&gt; <strong>Home Directory</strong> Tab</li>\r\n<li><strong>Configuration</strong> -&gt; <strong>Mappings</strong> Tab</li>\r\n<li>Add <strong>new mapping</strong></li>\r\n<li>Extension: <strong>.*</strong>&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Executable path: <strong>C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\aspnet_isapi.dll</strong> (or copy .aspx extension). Note, by default the file selector looks for .EXE files, so change to *.*. I looked at this blankly for a minute when I couldn't see the DLL I wanted! Doh...</li>\r\n<li>Verbs: <strong>GET,HEAD,POST,DEBUG</strong></li>\r\n<li>Check file exists - <strong>No</strong></li>\r\n<li>Click <strong>Ok</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Not for production, but good enough for your development machine! This post gave me the hint I needed: <a href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/dorony/archive/2007/12/15/using-asp-net-mvc-on-iis-5.aspx\">http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/dorony/archive/2007/12/15/using-asp-net-mvc-on-iis-5.aspx</a></p>\r\n<p>N.B. If you find that the <strong>Ok</strong> button is greyed out (it was for me), then click back in the Exectuable field and see if the <strong>Ok</strong> button is now available. If not, try any other extension rather than &quot;.*&quot; until the <strong>Ok</strong> button is enabled and then switch back to &quot;.*&quot;. Worked for me.</p>",
