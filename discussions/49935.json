In the meantime, I saw this tutorial on decoupling the membership database from Kigg so that you can use other providers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://danhounshell.com/blogs/dan/archive/2008/07/14/how-to-decouple-the-asp-net-membership-database-from-kigg.aspx\">http://danhounshell.com/blogs/dan/archive/2008/07/14/how-to-decouple-the-asp-net-membership-database-from-kigg.aspx</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink that might work? The article's a little old, so I wanted to double-check before investing some time trying it. I'm sort of stuck using CommunityServer at work, and I wanted to implement a Kigg-like feature. When I came across this project I got really excited. It's perfect for what I'm looking for as far as features go. Great job!\r\n",
