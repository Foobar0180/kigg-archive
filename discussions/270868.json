I will wait for the roadmap topic from your side on this discussion forum.</p>\n<p>I understand it is difficult to stick with any date or something. But I would deeply appreciate if you could just give an approx. idea when you think KIGG 4 will be released.</p>\n<p>I want to know because I want to make a decision based on that whether I should start my website on Current Version or should I wait for KIGG 4.</p>\n<p>Any idea you can give like : end of this year ? or beginning / mid / end of 2012 ? or any approx month like Oct,&nbsp; Nov or Dec 2011?</p>",
