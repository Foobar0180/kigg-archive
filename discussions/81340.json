I've configured it at default port (port 80). When I try to browse it using this url http://localhost/KiGG then it doesn't show any page but it lists all the directories and files in KiGG directory. I couldn't find any default page settings. Can anybody please help me how can I make my KiGG running?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>",
