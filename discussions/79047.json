I have learnt a lot from you guys and I really like read kigg's code :)</p>\r\n<p>But I have also a question about tables: User and Story, where you use GUID as a ID for table. Why you do that? I've read that integer/numeric is much better for ID purposes and the only reason to use GUID is to connect databases (replication) which doesn't happen in kigg's code.<br><br>Regards,<br>Jacek Ciereszko</p>",
