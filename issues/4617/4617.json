      "Message": "OMG, I was going to write the same comment and just found that you wrote it :o). Yes I totally agree.\r\nFor now I modified the code to retain old constructors your overwrite. This will maintain backward compatability with old configurations. Beside title filter is not mandatory parameter. We should implement it as RegEx though. But not sure if I can make it in this v2.5 release or not. So might open another issue for it after we are done with this release",
