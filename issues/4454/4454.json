    "Description": "The list of default Open ID providers listed on the Login screen does not include Facebook or Google. It would be nice if these and other popular Open ID providers (Yahoo, maspace etc.) could be added to the list.\n\nAlso I see the code is using ID Selector (www.idselector.com), do you plan to upgrade to RPX (rpxnow.com)?",
