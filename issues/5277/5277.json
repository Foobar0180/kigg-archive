    "Description": "As posted in another section, I cannot delete stories and i am getting an 'unexpected error' message. I am now updating this to report that the same message appears if I try to 'approve a story as spam' (text as used by Kigg): An unexpected error has occurred while confirming story as spam.\nThis gets a bit messy: I cannot delete stories, however i cannot mark them as spam either because of the above so if I want to publish stories , I am also forced to publish 'unwanted' stories. A solution to this would be most appreciated\n\nthanks\n\nMarco",
