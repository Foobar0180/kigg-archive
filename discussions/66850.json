But everytime when i try to use OpenID page will always give a server 500 error. And I have no idea how to find out the root cause for this. I tired in my localhost OpenID works very good. Only difference is RootUrl setting in web.config. I changed it from localhost to http://mydomainname.com&nbsp; also i changed whitelistHosts to my domain name. Can someone give me some clues?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
