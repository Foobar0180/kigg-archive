I did a google on <br>Caching Application Block vs not System.Web.Caching.Cache and a few forum threads said that there is no difference and it's recommended to<br>use System.Web.Caching.Cache for ASP.NET apps. What is your opinion on this? Why did you choose to use EntLib Caching Block?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>John</p>\r\n<p><img id=smallDivTip style=\"border:1px solid blue;z-index:90;left:60px;top:287px\" alt=\"\"></p>",
