    "Description": "A way to virally increase the usage of KiGG based websites would be to add a way to \"Invite Friends\" to join as well.\n\n1. This could/should be baked into the registration process but also available as a separate link (in case this step was missed, or skipped) -- a good spot for this would be in the users' detail page.\n2. The contacts to invite will be pulled from user's existing email accounts on Yahoo, Gmail, MSN etc (a-la Plaxo invite)\n3. Invitation email content should be made configurable in MailTemplates\n\nI can provide more information about this should it be required.",
