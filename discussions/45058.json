    "Html": "Hi everyone, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have tried to install Kigg 2.0 on Windows 2008 and SQL 2008. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are in fact no installation instructions (except some 10 lines in a text file) and I tried a lot, but up till now have not been able to get anything other than some error messages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould anyone please post a more detailled installation instruction doing it from scratch? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. I created the database in SQL2008 via Database\\Create.Sql<br>\r\n2. I Populated some data in it via the Database\\Data.sql script<br>\r\n3. I created a virtual directory in IIS named Kigg (I put it right into wwwroot, so I can reach it via <a href=\"http://localhost/kigg\">http://localhost/kigg</a>)<br>\r\n4. I created accounts at websnapr.com and recaptcha.net<br>\r\n5. I opened the minimal.config in an editor<br>\r\n6. I Renamed minimal.config to web.config<br>\r\n7. I replaced the YOUR- with meaningful values<br>\r\n8. I opened the kigg.sln and ran<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for the description in the textfile :-(<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the problems: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The textfile does not mention anything about the database connection string. You have to modify it to use anything other than sqlexpress.<br>\r\n2. The textfile does not mention anything where you have to point the virtual folder to. I figured it had to be the Web subfolder of the v2.x folder? <br>\r\n3. After doing this the webpage shows an error complaining that the webpage is not an application, so I converted the virtual folder to an application and put the Classic .NET AppPool in. <br>\r\n4. The textfile does not mention anything about security, authentication, authorization etc. I am a bit lost here what the application does need to work without having to open everything for all people out there. <br>\r\n5. Now the webpage tells me &quot;Server Error in /kigg Application&quot; The ressource cannot be found. Requested url: /kigg/default.aspx. At that point I do not know what else to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for your help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCU<br>\r\n   Andreas Kroll<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",

Yes the web under the 2.x directory.<br>\r\n3. No for IIS 7 it will run in DefaultAppPool.<br>\r\n4. N/A<br>\r\n5. For II7 you do not need the Default.aspx file.
