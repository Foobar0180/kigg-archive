Remove a directory under C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\Temporary ASP.NET Files with the name of your site. This is a cache version and gets created again, once you run the solution. Then under c:\\windows\\assembly\\gac_MSIL, there is a directory named system.web.mvc. delete the contents of that directory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCopy the new Mvc RC1 dlls to the bin directory of your project, or you can just load the projects to your solution and make sure your references are pointing to those dlls. Once you compile the code you get about 3 errors related to RequestContext. In every case, just modify the code, since the object that is complaining about has a RequestContext member (just put .RequestContext). Comment the line in web.config related to loading the system.mvc.dll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor me the above steps solved the issue and it is running with MVC RC1. However, now I have anothe issue which is I cannot add any stories and all the wait screens(from jQuery) stay there for ever. It seems the success event does not go back to the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope it helps.\r\n",
