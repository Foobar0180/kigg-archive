I already started on that and I expect it to be done by end of June. MySQL support might be done by mid of June.</p>\r\n<p>Note sure if the next would be building alpha version of KiGG based on .Net 4.0. It wouldn't be hard, but in my own plan I would wish to build another EF implementation based on EF4 using POCO, and keeping the current implementation as it is of course.</p>\r\n<p>So yes, .Net 4 and VS2010 are in mind. But when! only God knows</p>",
