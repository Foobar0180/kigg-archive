    "Description": "So whats the deal withthe way the publishable story counts works- it nevers drops below 20. Also when i publish the upcoming stories it alsO re-publishes stories that were already published. Example - a story published one day then says published a few moments ago. Where in the source is this behavior such that i can fix it so the publishable count goes to 0. ",
